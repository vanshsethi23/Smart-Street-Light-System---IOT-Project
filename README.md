## Overview

The Smart Street Light System is an innovative IoT project designed to efficiently manage street lighting in urban areas. It integrates technology to enhance urban lighting systems, promoting energy efficiency and automation. Energy-efficient LED lights, coupled with sensors and controls, adjust illumination based on environmental factors, reducing energy consumption and costs.

## Features

- **Automatic Brightness Adjustment**: Street lights adjust their brightness levels based on ambient light conditions, ensuring optimal illumination at all times.
- **Motion Detection**: Lights change brightness when motion is detected in the vicinity, enhancing security and safety for pedestrians and motorists.
- **Energy Efficiency**: By intelligently managing lighting schedules and brightness levels, the system significantly reduces energy consumption and operational costs.
